# Email-deAnonymizer
A small project I created for my Spring 2018 Introduction to Machine Learning independent study course

This model uses the Enron Email Dataset (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/) to classifier emails based on their original senders.

To use this program:
1. Download the Enron Email Datasat (https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~enron/), make sure you have a stable internet connection and lots of space.
2. Open "Move, rename, and clean files.py" and change datasetLocation to wherever you saved the Enron Email dataset and change fileDestination to wherever you would like the prepared files to go.
3. Save and run "Move, rename, and clean files.py", this might take a couple minutes.
4. Open "Email_deanonymizer.py" and change dataset_location to wherever you saved the files created by "Move, rename, and clean files.py" earlier.
5. Save and run "Email_deanonymizer.py", be prepared to have your CPU maxed out for a while.
